### Hi there 👋 😄

I'm Allen, finishing up my degree in Computer Science at Colby College 🐴.

I am technically curious and motivated, and am enthusiastic about cloud native technologies, machine learning, and embedded systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy hacking on IoT and woodworking, particularly when I can think of a way to stuff electronics into my woodworking projects. 🤔
